Some explation about this Exam.
in the main we have the core of the script. 

for getting users choise we are using the file "get_user_input" 
and passing it as a dict. 

then i created a TF file with those user choices from the menu. using the file "generate_tf.py" 
and it created the file "generated_tf.tf"


i had a problem then i creatted fake ID, DNS name, but i also printed the DNS and the EC2 that we have in the AWS
i did that in the file "boto3mission.py"

then i saved all the info in the aws_validtion.json, (it is in the "json_saving.py")# pythonExam2
